# Trump-Twitter-and-Text

I used the  Twitter API to analyze Trump's tweets for Data Science 100. After graphing the times he tweeted from his Android and iPhone, the data reveals Trump tweets from the Android while his staff tweet from his iPhone. Moreover, the data also shows he used the Android the most in the beginning of his Presidency and then transitioned to the iPhone in 2017. Additionally, I analyzed the tweets for whether they carried a positive or a negative sentiment using the VADER lexicon. Compared to fox news, Trump's tweets about the New York Times are almost always negative. Then I looked into what / who he tweets the most about and found the results to be 'Kim', 'Jong', 'Un'. The project concluded there is a relationship between how many times Trump's tweets are retweeted and whether or not those tweets carry a positive or a negative sentiment from tweeter himself: Trump.
